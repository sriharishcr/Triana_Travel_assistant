OVERVIEW - (Travel Assistant)

With the help of Triana Travel Assistant, we offer a practical method for
users to reserve any type of hotel room and transportation ticket through a
chat-bot.

WHAT IT DOES..?

It is a comprehensive travel assistant that will assist the user in booking various forms of transportation, including trains, cabs, buses, and flights, as well as hotels.

Additionally, our bot will manage the payment transaction.

The bot contains a few sophisticated APIs for predicting the weather in the cities that the user has entered.

The distance and time required to go from the starting point to the boarding point are calculated using a distance matrix API.

Users have options with the integrated ML model that predicts the Ticket cost of a flight.

A separate NodeJS server uses MongoDB to store all user input data for the bot.
